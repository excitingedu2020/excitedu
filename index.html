<p>There are also other things which can be done to help students feel a little more energized during class, such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Students take break to stretch and look away from computer every 20-25 minutes</li>
  <li>Since students are all at home, they can get a healthy snack to have during classes.</li>
  <li>Talk to your family during lunch and try to be away from a laptop for some time</li>
</ul>
